This is the repository for my APPM 4600 Conjugate Gradient Method Project. 
In this project, our group will examine the conjugate gradient descent as a method to efficiently find solutions to systems of equations using conjugate vectors. A useful way to conceptualize the conjugate gradient method is that it acts like the steepest descent but instead “remembers” the previous directions it has traveled. We will begin with the steepest descent method and then derive the conjugate gradient descent method from it. For our extension, we used the conjugate gradient method to solve discretized partial differential equations and separately created a preconditioner to increase the rate of convergence.
