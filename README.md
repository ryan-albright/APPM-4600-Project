This is the repository for my APPM 4600 Conjugate Gradient Method Project. 
In this project, our group will examine the conjugate gradient descent as a method to efficiently find solutions to systems of equations using conjugate vectors. A useful way to conceptualize the conjugate gradient method is that it acts like the steepest descent but instead “remembers” the previous directions it has traveled. We will begin with the steepest descent method and then derive the conjugate gradient descent method from it. For our extension, we will investigate the use of the conjugate gradient method in solving partial differential equations.
